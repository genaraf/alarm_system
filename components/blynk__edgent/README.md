## Features

- **Blynk.Inject**: connect your devices easily using [**Blynk IoT App**][blynk-apps] (iOS and Android)
  - `BLE`-assisted device provisioning for the best end-user experience
  - `WiFiAP`-based provisioning for devices without BLE support - *(soon)*
- **Network Manager**: Advanced network connection management and troubleshooting
  - `WiFi`: Maintains connection to the most reliable WiFi network (up to 16 configured networks)
  - `Ethernet`: Supports `Static IP` or `DHCP` network configuration
  <!--
  - `Cellular`: Provides connectivity through `2G GSM`, `EDGE`, `3G`, `4G LTE`, `Cat M1`, or `5G` networks using `PPP`
  -->
- Secure **Blynk.Cloud** MQTT connection that provides simple API for:
  - Data transfer with `DataStreams`, reporting `Events`, and accessing `Metadata`
- **Blynk.Air** - automatic, managed Over The Air firmware updates using Web Dashboard
  - Direct firmware upgrade using iOS/Android App before device activation - *(soon)*

Supported targets:
```
✅ ESP32, ESP32-S3, ESP32-C2, ESP32-C3, ESP32-C5, ESP32-C6
⏳ ESP32-S2 - coming soon
❌ ESP32-P4, ESP32-H4
```

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Blynk.Edgent component is provided for specific ESP-IDF versions.  
> See the [Release Notes](https://github.com/Blynk-Technologies/Edgent-ESP-IDF/releases) for compatibility details.

## Getting Started

- Sign up/Log in to your [Blynk Account](https://blynk.cloud)
- Install **Blynk IoT App** for [iOS][blynk-ios] or [Android][blynk-android]
- Create a new Product Template. This will provide you with `Template ID` and `Template Name`.

## 1. Build firmware

```sh
idf.py create-project-from-example "blynk/edgent:basic"
cd basic

# Configure the target chip
idf.py set-target esp32

# Configure Blynk.Edgent component
idf.py menuconfig
```

In `menuconfig`, navigate to:

```txt
(Top) → Component config → Blynk.Edgent
```

- Set `Template ID`
- Set `Template Name`
- Save configuration and exit
- Build and flash firmware


## 2. Connect your device to Blynk.Cloud

1. Open **Blynk IoT App** on your smartphone
2. Click **Add device** -> **Find devices nearby**
3. Select your device and follow the wizard instructions

The device should appear `online` once the above steps complete successfully.

See the device log via `idf.py monitor`:

```log
I (771) edgent.c: Blynk.Edgent initialized (device: Blynk Demo-N1A9)
I (771) edgent.c: State: IDLE => CONNECTING_NET
I (771) example: State change event received
I (851) nm_wifi.c: Connecting to SSID:wifi BSSID 2c:c8:1b:xx:xx:xx CH:11

I (2981) edgent.c: State: CONNECTING_CLOUD => RUNNING
I (2981) example: State change event received
I (2981) example: Initial connection established
I (2991) example: [main] Cloud connected event received! Continuing...
```

</details>

<!--
> [!NOTE]
> If you have already created your device in Blynk,
> you can [connect it manually using REPL](_extra/Cookbook.md#manual-device-connection)
-->

The example application also handles the on-board button:

- **Double click** – start provisioning without resetting the previous configuration, allowing reconfiguration.  
- **Long press** – perform a full configuration reset and start provisioning.

## Adding to existing project

```sh
idf.py add-dependency "blynk/edgent"
```

If your project uses [`MINIMAL_BUILD`](https://docs.espressif.com/projects/esp-idf/en/stable/esp32/api-guides/build-system.html#cmake-build-properties), consider disabling it, or add build dependencies explicitly:
```
esp_event esp_netif esp_wifi esp_https_ota
esp_partition efuse nvs_flash mqtt json bt esp_eth
```

## OTA configuration

Minimum flash size requirement for OTA updates is `4MB`.

You should select a dual-bank partition table, for example:
```txt
(Top) → Partition Table → Partition Table → Two large size OTA partitions
```

## Ethernet configuration

To enable Ethernet:

1. Go to: **Top → Component config → Blynk.Edgent**  
   and enable the **"Use Ethernet"** option.

2. Then go to: **Top → Example Ethernet Configuration**  
   and configure the adapter according to type, options, and pins.

> Example: `sdkconfig.T-Internet-POE` file contains a sample configuration for the [LilyGO T-Internet-POE](https://lilygo.cc/products/t-internet-poe) board.
